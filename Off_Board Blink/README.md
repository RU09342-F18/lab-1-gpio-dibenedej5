# Off Board Blink
This part of the lab required removing the processor from the microcontroller and putting it onto a protoboard. First, the code for the section of the lab "multiple blink' was programmed  onto the MSP430G2553 microcontroller, and then put the processor was applied to the protoboard. Then, using the datasheet, the relevant pins of the processor were wired indidually to power, LEDs, and ground. The microcontroller without the processor was used as a power supply for the protobaord. 3.3 V from the uC was wired to VDD and the reset pin, in order to keep the processor from constantly resetting and ruining the program. The 1.0 and 1.6 pins were connected to LEDs, so they could blink with instructions from the processor. And finally, ground from the uC was wired to Vss. Two 1000 ohm resistors were used in series from the negataive end of one of the LEDs to ground in order to limit the current through the circuit.
